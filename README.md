First-Website


This is my first WEB Application for buying car wheels. It was given to me as a practical task by the Wezom WEB company. I needed to create a website based on the PSD layout. At first, It was difficult for me because I hadn't learnt CSS and HTML before at the College. But after a week I had started to understand more and more each day. 
By the way, I think it was an exciting and quite interesting project like the First Project. This gave me insight into how the website works from the inside out.
